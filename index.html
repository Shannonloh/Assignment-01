    <h3>Internet</h3>

    <div class="subtitle">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</div>

        This article is about the worldwide computer network. For other uses, see Internet (disambiguation).

    <p>Not to be confused with the World Wide Web.</p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Internet</strong> is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link several billion devices worldwide. It is a <span style="color: #B02418; font-style: italic;">network of networks</span> that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), the infrastructure to support email, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing and telephony.

        The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United States government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer networks.[2] This work, combined with work in the United Kingdom and France, led to the primary precursor network, the ARPANET, in the United States. A 1980 paper refers to "the ARPA internet". <span style="color: #EA3323;">The interconnection of regional academic networks in the 1980s marks the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet.</span> From the early 1990s, the network experienced sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to it.
